The licking kid is a pretty funny thought to me."

I love the first one which just scares people because its so pointless funny and i can just imagine how scared id be knowing that story as a kid. the other legends however are wayy too basic for my good."

In my opinion that looks pretty dumb considering its probably just a misspelling of another youkai and it has no real unique trade except for the appearence."

Its also said that its derived from Amanozako, a deity from the Shintou mythology. The fact that its so so old and its nature i really like it, has a great potential."

She's very picky and does nothing what others expect and gets very mad when not getting what she wants. She has some unique and nice trades and manipulates people but shes basically a spoiled problemchild which makes me really dislike her. (And her birth is gross)"

Funny story and pretty harmless as its not a very serious illness. So silly"
