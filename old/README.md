# Welcome to Argui's Reviews

Argui's Reviews is a silly little side project of mine where I delve into a wide array of topics. 
I love exploring random and new dumb things, and often weeks, months, or even years later, 
I'm in a situation where i need said topic (happens too often when buying cheese and buying the ones i hate).

## Why did i create this Site?

I created this site simply for entertaining and information gathering of my own likes and dislikes. It all 
started because of previously mentioned cheese buying problem! Since this project 
is primarily for my own reference and for those close to me, I don't focus on optimizing code or 
making everything clean. I simply code however i code in that moment and as soon as its finished i leave it as is.

## What do i review?

Everything from food, to animals, to shows, to events in history and anything really that piques my interest.
Now i sometimes also review stuff that is a bit controversial and i'm fully aware of this. i  however do not mean to 
harass anyone with that, talk bad about someone or anything in that regard, i'm just having my fun with those little
random ratings.

## Found this Site and have wishes or complaints?

If you happen to stumble upon Argui's Reviews and have questions, suggestions, or even complaints, please feel 
free to get in touch. You can reach me there: (not yet a feature, too bad!)

## In Conclusion

That's pretty much all I wanted to say here. Thank you for taking the time to read about Argui's Reviews. 
Whether you find enjoyment in my silly entries or discover new information about niche topics, I hope you 
have a great time exploring my reviews!
